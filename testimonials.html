		<section>
			<p class="paragraph paraTestOne">"I booked Ismail to speak to a group of young men I mentor and was thoroughly impressed with his message... I really appreciated his ability to <em>connect with his audience.</em> I would absolutely recommend him for future events."
			<br>
			<em>- Jordan O.</em>
			</p>
		</section>
		<section>
			<p class="paragraph paraTestTwo"> "Everything about working with iAM Legend LLC was phenomenal. From start to finish, contracting him as a motivational speaker for our youth was exactly as he promised. The power of his story of overcoming adversity, developing himself and seeking continue growth was all you could hope to hear from an African American man. I highly recommend him!"
			<br>
			- Ruqayyah R.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section class="paragraph paraTestThree">
			<p>"iAM Legend LLC and Ismail led our group of 55 Black and Brown men through three dynamic workshops during our Center for Male Engagement summer program. The value that Ismail brought would be hard to quantify, because each of the 55 students learned their own lesson that they needed to learn. That is why we will ask him back semester after semester. The care and prior planning that he did showed in his ability to connect with our students beyond the superficial. His charisma allowed students to shed the masks they often wore and get uncomfortable in order to grow. I highly recommend Ismail & iAM Legend LLC for any small or large workshops, conferences, keynotes, and more!"</p>
